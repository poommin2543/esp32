# ESP32 Project Repository

Welcome to the ESP32 Project Repository! This repository contains various projects and code examples designed for the ESP32 microcontroller. Each project folder includes all the necessary files to build and run the project on your own ESP32 device.

## Projects

- **Check Senser**: Check each sensor to see if it can work normally or not.
- **ESP-Now**: This is an example code for sending data to multiple boards or a single board that sends data in one direction, both receiving and sending.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
- An ESP32 development board
- The Arduino IDE or ESP-IDF installed on your computer
- Necessary libraries installed (list any specific libraries used across the projects)

### Installation

To run any project, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/poommin2543/esp32.git
```


2. Open the project folder you are interested in with your IDE.
3. Compile and upload the code to your ESP32.

## Usage

To use the projects, simply upload the project code to your ESP32 device following the installation instructions. Adjust any configurations as described in the individual project READMEs, if available.

## Contributing

Contributions are what make the open-source community such a fantastic place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**.
